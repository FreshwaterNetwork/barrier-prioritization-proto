# barrier-prioritization-proto

Natural solutions toolkit plugin to prioritize aquatic barriers. Sends input weights to a ArcGIS Server geoprocessing service. Accepts results as map services and table. Slightly modified version of the original barrier-prioritization app to fit within the new CR framework better until the revamped version that complies with the style guide (FreshwaterNetwork/barrier-prioritization-proto2) is complete.
